JavaScript ES6:
Indentation: The distance of an indent is 2 spaces
Tabs indentation: Each level of indentation will be 1 tab
Space indentation: Indentation levels are separated by 2 spaces (for example, 2 spaces with first indentation, 4 spaces with second indentation, ...)
Avoid horizontal scrolling: One line of code limited by 80 characters
Blank lines are not harmful: Use blank lines to separate unrelated code blocks or logic
Naming convention: Use camelCase rule to name
Constructors: Use the PascalCase rule for functions used to initialize an object
